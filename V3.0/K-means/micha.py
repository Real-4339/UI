"""We have a 2D space that has X and Y dimensions, ranging from -5000 to +5000. Fill this 2D space with 20 points, each point having a randomly selected position using X and Y coordinates. Each point has unique coordinates (ie, there should not be more than one point in the exact same location).

After generating 20 random points, generate another 40000 points, but these points will not be generated completely randomly, but in the following way:

Randomly select one of all points created so far in 2D space. (not only from the first 20)
If the point is too close to the edge, reduce the corresponding interval in the next two steps.
Generate a random number X_offset in the interval from -100 to +100
Generate a random number Y_offset in the interval from -100 to +100
Add a new point in 2D space that will have the same coordinates as the randomly selected point in step 1, offset by X_offset and Y_offset

"""The way kmeans algorithm works is as follows:

Specify number of clusters K.
Initialize centroids by first shuffling the dataset and then randomly selecting K data points for the centroids without replacement.
Keep iterating until there is no change to the centroids. i.e assignment of data points to clusters isnâ€™t changing.
Compute the sum of the squared distance between data points and all centroids.
Assign each data point to the closest cluster (centroid).
Compute the centroids for the clusters by taking the average of the all data points that belong to each cluster."""
